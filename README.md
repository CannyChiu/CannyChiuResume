# CannyChiuResume
A version of Canny's resume built using HTML/CSS

As part of my JUNO College program, I've been asked to build a resume using HTML/CSS.
This was my first solo project ever so this code is definitely not great, but I am super proud to have done a web development course to learn more about web development.
